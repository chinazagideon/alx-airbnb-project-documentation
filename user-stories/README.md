# Airbnb Clone Backend (Microservices & AI-Powered)
# Project Overview

This project is an ambitious, enterprise-scalable backend for an Airbnb-like rental marketplace. Developed as a key component of my professional portfolio, it showcases a robust microservices architecture seamlessly integrated with Big Data capabilities and AI powered features such as personalized search and ad listings.

The core objective is to simulate a real-world, high-traffic application, demonstrating proficiency in scalable system design, secure API development, asynchronous communication, and intelligent data processing.
