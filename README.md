![uml architechure diagram](./features-and-functionalities-uml-img.png 'My UML Diagram')

## Project Overview

This project is an ambitious, enterprise-scalable backend for an Airbnb-like rental marketplace. Developed as a key component of my professional portfolio, it showcases a robust microservices architecture seamlessly integrated with Big Data capabilities and AI powered features such as personalized search and ad listings.

The core objective is to simulate a real-world, high-traffic application, demonstrating proficiency in scalable system design, secure API development, asynchronous communication, and intelligent data processing.

## Key Features

This backend supports a comprehensive set of functionalities, designed to mimic a modern rental platform:

### Core Functionalities

1.  **User Management**:

      * **User Registration**: Allow sign-up as `guests` or `hosts`.
      * **User Login & Authentication**: Secure login via email/password, with support for `OAuth` (e.g., Google, Facebook).
      * **Profile Management**: Users can update profiles, including photos, contact info, and preferences.
      * **Security**: `JWT` (JSON Web Tokens) for secure sessions and `Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)` for guests, hosts, and admins.

2.  **Property Listings Management**:

      * **Add Listings**: Hosts can create detailed property listings (title, description, location, price, amenities, availability).
      * **Edit/Delete Listings**: Hosts can manage their existing properties.

3.  **Search and Filtering**:

      * Comprehensive search by location, price range, number of guests, and amenities (Wi-Fi, pool, pet-friendly).
      * Includes `pagination` for large datasets.

4.  **Booking Management**:

      * **Booking Creation**: Guests can book properties for specific dates, with `date validation` to prevent double bookings.
      * **Booking Cancellation**: Guests or hosts can cancel bookings based on policies.
      * **Booking Status**: Tracks statuses (pending, confirmed, canceled, completed).

5.  **Payment Integration**:

      * Secure payment gateway integration (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) for `upfront payments` by guests.
      * `Automatic payouts` to hosts post-booking completion.
      * Support for `multiple currencies`.

6.  **Reviews and Ratings**:

      * Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties.
      * Hosts can respond to reviews.
      * Reviews are linked to specific bookings.

7.  **Notifications System**:

      * Email and in-app notifications for critical events (booking confirmations, cancellations, payment updates).

8.  **Admin Dashboard**:

      * An administrative interface for monitoring and managing users, listings, bookings, and payments.

9.  **Multiple Language Support**:

    * Multi-language design support 

### AI-Powered Enhancements

Beyond core features, this project integrates intelligent capabilities to enhance user experience and platform efficiency:

  * **AI-Powered Search**:
      * Advanced search functionality that leverages AI for **relevancy ranking**, personalizing results based on user behavior and preferences.
      * Includes features like `autosuggest` and `typo correction`.
  * **Personalized Ad Listings/Recommendations**:
      * A recommendation engine suggesting properties tailored to individual user interests, viewing history, and booking patterns.
      * This service can also intelligently surface "promoted" or highly relevant listings.

## Technical Architecture

The backend is built upon a **Microservices Architecture** emphasizing scalability, resilience, and maintainability.

### **Microservices Breakdown**

Each service is an independently deployable unit, communicating asynchronously via an event streaming platform.

1.  **`Identity & User Service`**: Manages user authentication (registration, login, profile management) and RBAC.
      * **Database**: PostgreSQL
      * **Authentication**: JWT, OAuth
2.  **`Listing Service`**: Handles the lifecycle of property listings (add, edit, delete, retrieve).
      * **Database**: PostgreSQL
3.  **`Booking Service`**: Manages all booking operations (creation, cancellation, status tracking).
      * **Database**: PostgreSQL
4.  **`Payment Service`**: Integrates with payment gateways for secure transactions and host payouts.
      * **Database**: PostgreSQL/MySQL
      * **Integrations**: Stripe, PayPal SDKs
5.  **`Review Service`**: Manages property reviews and ratings.
      * **Database**: PostgreSQL/MySQL
6.  **`Notification Service`**: Dispatches email and in-app notifications.
      * **Integrations**: SendGrid/Mailgun
7.  **`File Storage Service`**: Abstracts cloud storage for property images and user photos.
      * **Storage**: AWS S3 or Cloudinary
8.  **`Admin Service`**: Provides an interface for platform administration and monitoring.
      * **Database**: Read-only access or data consumed via event streams.
9.  **`Data Ingestion & Analytics Service`**: Centralized ingestion and processing of all system events for analytics and AI model training.
      * **Event Streaming**: Apache Kafka
      * **Data Storage**: Data Lake (S3), Data Warehouse (PostgreSQL or cloud DWH)
      * **Processing**: Apache Spark (for batch), Flink (for real-time)
10. **`Search & Discovery Service`**: Powers the AI-enhanced search and filtering capabilities.
      * **Search Engine**: Elasticsearch/Apache Solr
      * **AI Models**: Custom ranking and personalization algorithms
      * **Caching**: Redis
11. **`Recommendation & Personalization Service`**: Generates personalized listing recommendations and informs "ad listings."
      * **AI Models**: Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering, Deep Learning models
      * **Feature Store**: Redis, Feast

### **Cross-Cutting Concerns**

  * **API Gateway**: Single entry point for all client requests, handling routing, authentication, rate limiting, and potentially GraphQL aggregation.
  * **Event Streaming Platform**: **Apache Kafka** serves as the asynchronous communication backbone, enabling real-time data flow.
  * **Database Management**: Predominantly **PostgreSQL/MySQL** for transactional data; potential for NoSQL databases and specialized data warehouses for analytics and AI.
  * **Caching**: **Redis** for improved response times and session management.
  * **Security**: JWT for sessions, RBAC, encryption (at rest and in transit), firewalls, rate limiting, and adherence to OWASP Top 10.
  * **Performance Optimization**: Horizontal scaling, load balancing, efficient database queries.
  * **Monitoring & Logging**: Centralized logging (e.g., ELK Stack), distributed tracing (Jaeger/Zipkin), and metrics/alerting (Prometheus/Grafana).
  * **Testing**: Comprehensive unit, integration, API, and performance testing using frameworks like `pytest`.

-----

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements

  * **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL (primary); potential for NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra) for specific services.
  * **API Development**: `RESTful APIs` primarily, with consideration for `GraphQL` via the API Gateway.
  * **Authentication**: JWT for user sessions, OAuth 2.0.
  * **File Storage**: AWS S3 or Cloudinary.
  * **Third-Party Services**: Mailgun (email), Stripe (payments).
  * **Error Handling**: Global error handling with robust logging.
  * **Containerization**: Docker.
  * **Orchestration**: Kubernetes (for production-grade deployment).
  * **CI/CD**: Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, AWS CodePipeline.
  * **Programming Languages**: (Python, Go, NextJs, FastApi).
